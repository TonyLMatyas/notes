# Overview
########################################
A good naming convention is useful for systems administration.  This document serves as a guide with examples.

# Tips
########################################
- Keep the hostname under 16 characters (because NetBIOS has a 15-character limitation).

- Add zeroes if the abbreviation is shorter than the character length - Examples of 4-letter combinations:
>> PHP = "php0"
>> Generic Database Server = "db00"

- When creating abbreviations, if the first syllable (or similar) of the word is the exact number of characters you need, that's usually a good choice because it's easier to remember - Examples:
>> Docker = "dock"
>> Kubernetes = "kube"
>> Jenkins = "jenk"
>> Nginx = "ngin"

- When creating abbreviations, to avoid duplicate abbreviations, when possible, use the least-common letters in the alphabet:
>> J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

- When creating abbreviations, to avoid duplicates, while not a rule, a good starting point is to (1) use the first letter then (2) skip the vowels - Examples:
>> Apache = "apch"
>> Maria DB = "mrdb"
